# ShinobiQuest
## Presentation
### What is this ?
ShinobiQuest is a 2D platformer game, based on Unity3D engine. The game will be designed for computer first, but will probably be adapted for mobile devices in a second time. Finally, a controller intergation should be released for every platform.

### What's the scenario ?
You are a young Shinobi, who have the privilege to be Sensei Taiyo's disciple. He tought you how to use your katana, and as a legacy of his width, the power over  fire. But if your master is so famous, it's due to his legendary secret sunny sushi recipe. If the latter were to fall into the wrong hands, the whole world would be in a terrible danger.
One day, the Yakuza's chief, Dakumun, sent his best men steal the recipe. Fortunatly, Sensei Taiyo had hidden it. So they kidnapped him instead, to make him reveal the recipe. 
The next morning, when you open the dojo's door, you find a letter of your master, explaining you the situation and asking you to find the recipe and deliver him.

### What about the price ?
Well, that's a sensitive question... The project is open-source (entirely or partially, depending of the evolution), so it will obviously be free. However, developer licenses aren't aren't chip, especially for iOS and PlayStation, so the game might include advertissments. You will also have the possibility to pay a life-time purchase, by contributing to the project financement (the amount is up to you) to unlock an add-free experience.
Later, a shop with customization options and skins might open, with a shop.
